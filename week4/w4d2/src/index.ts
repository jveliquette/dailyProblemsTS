/* Create a new Typescript project from scratch. Use the Moodle book How to start a new TypeScript Project to guide you.

After creating your new project, add a function called greeting to the .ts file that accepts a string parameter called name and returns the string "Hello " + name.

Run and test your code to make sure your output looks like the sample output.

Sample Output:

greeting("Abdi") ==> "Hello Abdi"

Once your code is working correctly, copy and paste the contents of your .ts file in the box below. */

function greeting(name: string): string {
    return "Hello " + name;
}
greeting("")
